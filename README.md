# Machine-Learning
These are mini projects undertaken while learning about machine learning

They include:
1. A machine learning model that uses a decision tree to predict if a passenger from the titanic survived using factors such as the passenger's age, sex, the class of the passenger and the fare he or she paid.

2. A machine learning model that uses a decision tree to predict the crime rate of a region using factors such as the no of graduates, the income of the region, the no of people working and the percentage of people who live in the city to predict the crime rate of a region.

3. A machine learning model that uses linear regression to predict the salary of a worker based on his or her years of experience.

4. A logisitic regression model that predicts the chances of a patient getting coronary heart disease in 10 years based on factors such as the gender, if he/she smokes, the no of cigarettes smoked per day and his or her age

# What I learnt:
1. Building machine learning models such as decision trees and linear regression models
2. How to seperate data into numerical and categorical variables
3. How to perform one-hot encoding on categorical varialbes to convert them to numerical variables which the ML model can read
4. Single imputation which cleans the data by replacing missing values of the numerical type with the mean of the data and categorical with the mode of the data
