# Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my repository of mini projects related to Machine Learning. Here, you'll find a collection of my work in building and implementing several types of Machine Learning models, including Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression.

# Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this project, I built a Machine Learning model using Decision Trees to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. I trained the model on data such as the passenger's age, sex, class, and fare paid, among other factors.

# Project 2: Crime Rate Prediction
Here, I built a Machine Learning model using Decision Trees to predict the crime rate of a region. I trained the model on data such as the number of graduates, income of the region, number of people working, and the percentage of people who live in the city.

# Project 3: Salary Prediction
I built a Linear Regression model to predict the salary of a worker based on his or her years of experience.

# Project 4: Heart Disease Prediction
Using Logistic Regression, I built a model that predicts the chances of a patient getting coronary heart disease in ten years based on factors such as gender, smoking habits, and age.

# Project 5: Handwritten Digit Recognition
Here, I used a Logistic Regression model to predict the number of handwritten digits in a dataset from the Scikit-Learn library.![hand_written_digit_predictor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116555573/208383421-4fcf1479-b350-4846-9840-f9b3800647c9.png)

# Project 6: Red Wine Quality Prediction
Finally, I used a Logistic Regression model to predict the quality of red wine on a scale from 1 to 10, using data such as fixed acidity and volatile acidity of the wine.![red_wine_quality_predictor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116555573/208393375-22c099c5-d88f-4c86-8749-eddbc031a54c.png)



# What I Learned
Through these projects, I gained experience in building and implementing various Machine Learning models, including Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression. Additionally, I learned how to preprocess data by separating it into numerical and categorical variables, perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables, and perform single imputation to replace missing values..

**Overall, these projects have provided me with a solid foundation in Machine Learning and data analysis, and I am eager to continue building my skills in this field.**
